# Python Socket Port Scanner and Banner Grabber

## About

This was a project I wanted to make to learn more about networking and Python. As of now, I wouldn't say that it's a good tool to use since it's pretty barebones, but I plan on improving it over time. 

## Installation

> git clone github.com/evanRubinsteinIT/socketScanner.git

> cd socketScanner

> chmod +x PortScan.py

## Use

As of now, this project doesn't support command line arguements. In order to use it, just launch the script and follow the prompts!
